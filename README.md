## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

For my portfolio I used an HTML template for the design. I went for a layout that was minimalistic and concise, all while being mobile responsive. I used Netlify to host my website with automatic deployments from Github to make future changes easier.

## Optimizations

I would like to include more of my client projects in my porfolio to give visitors a better idea of the kind of work that I can do.

## Lessons Learned:

Hosting on Netlify requires an index.html file. Having your main html file be named anything else will result in the hosted page not being displayed correctly.

When testing form submissions on Netlify, inputing "test" for any of the input fields will result in form not being submitted.
